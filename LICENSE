INTRODUCTION

This document has been drafted by the University of Costa Rica’s (herein and henceforth UCR’s) Vice-presidency for Research Office for Management and Transfer of Knowledge for Innovation (herein and henceforth PROINNOVA), dedicated to:

“[  ] transfer the knowledge generated by the UCR to impulse the innovation of the public and private productive sectors through intellectual property licensing” (Translated from: PROINNOVA (2014). Plan Estratégico 2014-20181. San Pedro, Costa Rica.).

In that regard, PROINNOVA creates licenses so UCR’s intellectual property can reach the users that require it and the knowledge for which it was created can achieve its purpose. Particularly, this is a license for a polyvalent lexicographical interface (inLEXpo®).

Through the UCR’s President’s Resolution R-289-2014 “Directrices para la puesta en marcha del plan de migración a software libre en la Universidad de Costa Rica”2, the university has committed itself to develop computer software and license as free software.

I.                     inLEXpo® SOFTWARE

The inLEXpo® software was developed by Professors Jorge Antonio Leoni-de León and Sergio Cordero-Monge, as an outcome of their research project 745-B1-001 “Interfaz lexicográfica polivante”3, from the Linguistics Research Institute (herein and henceforth INIL).

By Costa Rican law, and the UCR’s current policies and norms, this computer software is protected by authors’ rights, by which the UCR holds the economic rights, and the moral rights belong to: 

Jorge Antonio Leoni-de León, researcher,
Sergio Cordero-Monge, researcher, 
Ricardo Ernesto Monge-Gapper, computer programmer,
Diego Centeno-Quirós, computer programmer, and
Julián Astorga-Campos, computer programmer.
